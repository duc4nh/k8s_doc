fix 
Have you tried what I suggested above by removing ServiceAccount from your kube-apiserver's flag: --admission-control, and restart your kube-apiserver?
Error from server: error when creating "mysql.yaml": No API token found for service account "default", retry after the token is automatically created and added to the servi

- Pods allow you to keep related containers close in terms of the network and hardware
infrastructure. Data can live near the application, so processing can be done without
incurring a high latency from network traversal.

- Labels give us another level of categorization, which becomes very helpful in terms of
everyday operations and management. Similar to tags, labels can be used as the basis of
service discovery as well as a useful grouping tool for day-to-day operations and
management tasks.

- Replication controllers (RCs), as the name suggests, manage the number of nodes that a
pod and included container images run on. They ensure that an instance of an image is
being run with the specific number of copies.

- Health checks : Kubernetes provides two layers of health checking. First, in the form of HTTP or TCP
checks, K8s can attempt to connect to a particular endpoint and give a status of healthy on
a successful connection. Second, application-specific health checks can be performed
using command line scripts.
Kubernetes also supports health checks via simple TCP socket checks and also with
custom command-line scripts.

- Life cycle hooks or graceful shutdown :As you run into failures in real-life scenarios, you may find that you want to take
additional action before containers are shutdown or right after they are started. Kubernetes
actually provides life cycle hooks for just this kind of use case.
Controller definition defines both a postStart and a preStop 
action to take place before Kubernetes moves the container into the next stage of its life
cycle

- Application scheduling:
+ In the absence of all other constraints, 
the scheduler will place new pods on nodes with the least number of other pods belonging
to matching services or replication controllers.
+ Additionally, the scheduler provides the ability to add constraints based on resources
available to the node. Today, that includes minimum CPU and memory allocations. In
terms of Docker, these use the cpu-shares and memory limit flags under the covers.
+ Kubernetes will check a node for available
resources. If a node does not meet all the constraints, it will move to the next. If no nodes
can be found that meet the criteria, then we will see a scheduling error in the logs.
